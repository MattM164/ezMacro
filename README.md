# ezMacro
### A simple macro maker, made with ImGUI
Make macros with ease! Just add some keys and delays then hit play.  You can loop the macro as many times as you want.  You can also save macros for later!

What needs to be done:

  ---Add more keys.  Currently only character and number row keys can be put in a macro
  
 ---No way to tie a macro to a key combo on your keyboard.  Right now you have to click the play button to get it going.
  
  ---Have to add a setting tha tadds a delay to starting the macro just the first time.  And a setting to delay between loops.
  
  ---And more when I get these figured out.
